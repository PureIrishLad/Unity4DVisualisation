# Unity4DVisualisation

In-development tool that will allow for the building and displaying of 4-Dimensional objects in Unity.

Currently can display 4D objects as 3D cross-sections and process 4D movement and rotation. In the process of optimizing the generation of cross-sections and plan to implement 4D shape builder once this is optimized.
